# Accenture Code Challenge

Thank you for this opportunity - it has been a pleasure to work on this coding challenge.

I have left a video message explaining my thought process in file called “Explanation.mp4”.

Because I had limited time I have tried to cover more variety of skills rather than focus on implementation of specific area like code coverage, frontend styling etc.

I have not implemented typescript as I thought that this project is too small to benefit from TS - instead I have used propTypes to help with typing. If we would continue further development I would probably go with TypeScript.

**Here are few areas that I think I could improve this app if I were to work on further:**

- further typing (typescript integration)
- more code coverage (unit tests)
- more tests (end-2-end, integration, mocking msw)
- more layout options / further frontend development
- higher accessibility standards

**There were few questions that raised in my head prior to my development:**

- What is the responsiveness requirement? For what devices are we developing the app?
- What accessibility standards are we looking to meet? WCAG 2.1 AA or AAA etc.
- Are there any style guides and are there any technical requirements?
- What should we do if there is a problem with fetching data from API?

**To install the project there are no special requirements. I have worked on node v16.0.0**
`npm install` / `yarn`

To run the project:
`npm run start`

To run tests:
`npm run test`
